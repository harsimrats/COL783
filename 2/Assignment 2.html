<b> Part A: Face Morphing</b>
Implement triangle based approach for image morphing for face images. This would 
require:
</p><ul>
<li> Establishing correspondence of features, to beign with these may be 
provided interactively.
</li><li> Delaunay triangulation or any other triangulation available in 
the libray may be used for the purpose of obtaining the triangulation 
of feature points. One may have to add feature points 
at the boundary of the image to include the entire image.
</li><li> Creating intermediate frames using Barycentric coordinates.
</li></ul> 


<b> Part B: Face Swappingg</b>
The face morphing may be adapted for swapping two faces. This may require
the following:
<ul>
<li> Consider only the portion of the face that would be swapped. That is the 
tirnagulation will limit to the region to swap.
</li><li> Color adjustment to the respective sources. 
</li><li> The boundary of the region would need smoothing to avoid sharp edges.
</li><li> Pose/alignment adjustment.
</li></ul> 
<p>

<b> Part C: Filters for augmenting face</b>
This entails augmenting face image with filters (as used in snapchat). This 
may require the following.
</p><ul>
<li> Consider a set of filters like masks aligned on a template.
</li><li> Placement of the filter on the desired location
</li><li> Compositing with the original image. This may require defining 
appropriate alpha-map for the mask.
</li></ul> 
<p>


</p><h4> Note: </h4> 
<br>
<ol>
<li> You can do your assignment in a group of maximum size of two.
</li><li> Write a page report on the experiments and analysis which you will 
do with the different tools you will implement. 
</li></ol> <br> <p>
