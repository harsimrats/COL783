</p><h2>Assignment 0: Image Scaling/Reduction: Zooming In/Out</h2>
<p>
</p></center>
<p>
This is a warm up assignment as discussed in the class. The basic intent of 
this assignment is to perform the scaling operation to an image. The scaling
up should be done a) replication b) interpolation. The scaling down should be 
done with the corresponding operations as would be used for scaling up. Consider a 
window (a rectangular area) of a given size for the display within which the 
zoomed-in or out area is shown when placed on the image.
