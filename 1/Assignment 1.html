<p>
This assignment deals with processing of images so that these can be 
converted into painterly rendered images. There are two parts to the 
assignment. The first part of the assignment requires implementation 
of parts from the paper on color quantization see reference [1]. 
These are:

</p><ul>
<li> Polpularity algorithm
</li><li> Median cut algorithm
</li><li> Floyed and Steinberg algorithm
</li></ul>
<p>
The second part of the assignment requires implementation of edge detection
using eXtended Difference of Gaussian (xDoG) from the paper (reference [2]).
You are encouraged to try out different toning functions other than tanh.

</p><p> A final result in terms of non-photorealistic (or painterly) rendered
output you are required to combine the color quantization from fist part 
with edges obtained from the second part.
  
</p><h4> Note: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>Assignment can be done in a group of maximum size of two. The group
should not change later.
</li><li>For reading and writing images and other filter functions you may 
use built-in functions from a library like OpenCV/ImageMagick/MATLAB.
</li></ul>
<br>

<h4> Submission </h4> 
The submission of the assignment can be done by the group (if the
group is of two people, only one should submit and include the statement
about what constitutes the group. Should submit one gzip file with only 
code - no images- and can name the file student1_entrynumber+student2_entrynumber 
through <a href="https://moodle.iitd.ac.in/"> Moodle</a>.
